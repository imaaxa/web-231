// Line 9: Element with an id of id02 is not present in HTML, so the call was not finding an element to change, changed
to id01
// Line 11: String needs to be inside of single or double quotes.
// Attribution code was placed outside the HTML closing tag. JavaScript comments are not the same as HTML comments, so
it was being displayed as text on the page. Was moved to be inside the script tag before the first line of JavaScript
// The JavaScript code that was below the Attribution code is not required for this project, and was causing a JS error,
so they were removed
// HTML was missing the head open/close tags, along with the title and meta tags
